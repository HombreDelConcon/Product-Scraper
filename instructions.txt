Hello, there are two files I would like you to test:
	1 - tkinterGUI.py (Creates the user interface for the sraper)
	2 - getKeyword.py (Traverse sites and use the scrapers to retrieve product data)
	3 - prodScraper.py (Contains the scrapers themselves and I want 

Steps:
	* Before you start, I personally don't use the command prompt much but I 
	would higly suggest you run these files in the command prompt since we 
	are using an evironment and making a really long script just to run 
	files in an environment *
	 
	1 - run the autoImportLibs.py file to start with the creation of the 
	virtual environment. It will ask if you have an environment set up, type the
	number 2 to create the environment if it is not already created

	2 - When the environment is created, it will provide you with the path to 
	activating the environment, just copy and paste it on the command line

	3 - Once the environment is activated, run the autoImportLibs.py again 
	and this time type the number 1 to signal that the environment is created
	and activated. This will download all the libraries into the environment 
	(as long as you are in it).

	4 - Once the necessary libraries are installed, run the "pip list" command to
	make sure the following libraries are installed:
		> selenium                4.2.0
		> webdriver-manager       3.7.0
		> beautifulsoup4          4.11.1
		> pandas                  1.4.2
		> mysql-connector-python  8.0.29
		> pillow                  9.2.0
		> lxml                    4.8.0
		> customtkinter           4.5.1
		> requests                2.27.1
	if there are other libraries intalled as well, do not worry about those.

	5 - Once this is done, you can run the 3 python files and see if they run with no
	errors.

if exception:
	- Message me through teams or send an email with the name of the exception or a 
	screenshot of it

else:
	- Message me with the name of the program that ran with no exceptions

Debug:
	- Please send me a screenshot of the GUI from your perspectives, I've only tested
	the GUI on my desktop's aspect ratio and the size of most elements is relative to
	the size of the display so I am not sure how different displays will affect it

THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP ;)
