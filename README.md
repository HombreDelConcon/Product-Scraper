# Product-Scraper

This is an old web scraper which searches online retailers, more specifically I only made it to search Target, Amazon, and Newegg. 
The scraper will take a keyword as a parameter and search for products related to that keyword in the previously stated retailers.
This scraper needs to be debugged and made to be reproducible on other computers since this was originally designed to log to a
databse in my localhost as well as store all results in that database.
